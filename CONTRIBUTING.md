## Pull Requests

Thanks for helping this code base grow! In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve when submitting your PR:

- [ ] have a [proper commit history](#commits) (we advise you to rebase if needed).
- [ ] write tests for the code you wrote.
- [ ] preferably make sure that all tests pass locally.
- [ ] summarize your PR with a descriptive title and a message describing your changes, cross-referencing any related bugs/PRs.

## Commits

- Please keep each commit's changes small and focused--many changes in the same commit makes them harder to review.
- Please also combine each code-change within one commit rather than many commits. Rebase liberally.
- Please make all commit messages clear and communicative.

Following these rules keeps history cleaner, makes it easier to revert things, and it makes developers happier too.
