# Datadog Trace Forwarder

Shared libary for submitting traces to trace intake.
Features include:

-   Tools for building AWS Lambda Layer from library
-   Trace obfuscation, (using logic from datadog-agent)
-   Submits Stats/Transcations for traces
-   Python bindings

```python
from trace_forwarder.connection import TraceConnection
conn = TraceConnection("datadoghq.com", "my_api_key")
conn.send("""
{
  "traces": [
    [
      {

    ]
  ]
}
""")
```

## Requirements

-   dep
-   go 1.12 or higher
-   docker

## Building Go Binary

```bash
dep ensure
make
```

Output is saved to bin, and the shared library will be compatible with your local environment. If you want to build a linux compatible binary, you will need to use docker, (setting GOOS/GOARCH enviornment variable doesn't work for shared libraries).

```bash
./scripts/build_linux_go_bin.sh
```
